# Welcome to **[@chris-bishop](https://github.com/chris-bishop)**'s **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** hosted **[draw.io](https://draw.io/)** Diagrams Repository!

----

### **NOTE:** Diagrams will be listed here in chronological order by date of initial commit. Each diagram I share will be prefixed with a YYYYMMdd date code.

My intent is to keep this Diagram Wiki as Minimalist as possible in favor of focusing my dev efforts on my personal blog and professional portfolio site **[AssumeTheRole.com](https://assumetherole.com)**! If you landed here by way of my website, fantastic! If your journey has otherwise been "a long strange trip, indeed..." - after you are finished here, please take a few moments to nav on over to **[https://assumetherole.com/](https://assumetherole.com/)** - and see what other developer resources I may have shared with the OpenSource and Developer Communities to help us all continue to change the world through innovation!

Please feel free to fork my shared diagrams in to your own personal **[draw.io](https://draw.io/)** account, modify, and re-share to your hearts content! My goal is only to share my experiences with the OpenSource and Developer Communities in hopes they may at least save folks from having to re-invent the wheel, or at best inspire the next big innovation! ðŸ™‚
